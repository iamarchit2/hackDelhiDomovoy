This is a Web Based Decentralised Application which uses the BlockChain technology to create a "Digital Twin" of your house. The digital twin tracks the lifecycle of the house, automtes the Maintanance Activities and helps your house to improve itself, even when you are working out elsewhere.
It was built during the HackDelhi Hackathon organised by Ultrahack on 13 and 14 April 2019.
